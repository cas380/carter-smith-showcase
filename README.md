# Testing on localhost

## Manual setup

You will need Jekyll. You can check if you have Jekyll with `jekyll -v`.
If not, you will need Ruby and Gem to *install* Jekyll. 

Run the following:

  1. `ruby -v`
  2. `gem -v`
  3. `gem install jekyll bundler`

Now, from the root directory, you should be able to `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
This will host your site and (in the terminal) spit out its server address. 
Also, just for reference, here's [a good Jekyll tutorial/refresher playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB).

## "Automatic" setup

Once the above dependencies are accounted for, running the script `run.bat` will execute the `bundle` command for you.
