first_p: CS 1520 is a team-based, semester-long project class centered around web applications. It taught me how to make websites similar to this one (though not quite the same, seeing as this is a Jekyll site). My group created a game called <a href="https://cow-clicker-2.appspot.com/" target="_Blank">Cow Clicker 2</a>, which is hosted on Google Cloud Platform with a Flask backend and JavaScript frontend.
